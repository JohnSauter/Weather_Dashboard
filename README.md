# Weather_Dashboard
Display the weather at a specified location

Type a place name in the box below "Search for a City"
and the right side of the form will show weather information
for that city, including a five-day forecast.  Each city
named is added to the history list below the input box.
These names are kept in order by most recently used,
and persist across running the application.  Clicking
on a city on the list will display its weather and
bring it to the top of the list.
